So, so, so, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the second sequel from Respawn Entertainment. I have played the first game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and it's pretty good and it gets improvement on the second sequel. I didn't play it on its release because some issues that happened when the game was released, but for current state I would say they did a really good job to make it playable and I will talk about it further more later.

# Story

The story will continue from the first sequel, where now Cal Kestis should survive, and I will tell a little at the beginning of the story that Cal now has team that will help him to fight the empire. It is a pretty good story and they did a great job to the story, I won't complaint about its story because I think if it is intended to be a gameplay focus but I found that the story is pretty good.

# Gameplay

It is a few improvement from the first sequel, now you have five stance to use and to match your playstyle. Personally, I use double-bladed and dual wield, for me those two stances are the most effective. For you who is curious I will explain the stances.

1. Single: a normal stance that most of the jedi use
2. Double-bladed: a long lightsaber like Darth Maul's stance
3. Dual Wield: a two lightsaber that is held by each hand
4. Blaster: a single lightsaber with a blaster
5. Crossguard: a heavy sword look like lightsaber

Other things that new in this sequel is now Cal can stop time, when you meet difficult position or difficult encounter and you need to think or reposition you can use this skill, I think it will the same as ultimate and it needs to be recharge by attacking or defending.

And small other thing like BD-1 ability to unlock path, Cal's grappling hook to help maneuver and so much more. And love this gameplay because it feel like a souls like game but on easier gameplay. I play on Jedi Knight difficulty and sometime it was easy and sometimes it was very hard but overall it was a good experience!

# Graphics

I can't say anything than it is a gorgeous looking of landscape that has Star Wars characteristic, although it has only have a few planets but it's enough and each planets have its own scenery and I love it.

# Issues

As what I have already said that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has a few issues related to performance that I think Respawn Entertainment already tried at their best to fix it, but the problems still exist.

First thing is stutter, basic problem on Unreal Engine and as I remember Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has the same issue and they has the same problem on this sequel, but for me it's not a big issue and I still enjoy to play the game.

Second thing is crash, I encountered to some crashes and one of them was a bit annoying because I didn't save and it had some time and I had to redo the thing for some time. But I have behaviour to save every time I found a meditate place and after that one encountered I saved for the crash that happened.

Third one is weird and I'm asking why they didn't fix it, so at some time you have to navigate to a planet that using navigation on Mantis and guess what it drops you to 18 fps when open the map of planets! Since it isn't a big deal because you will open it just a few times, but still I shocked that it could happen. 

For your information I'm using Legion 5i pro 2022 so it is capable to play but the game seems heavy to run and I had to use DLSS on performance so it can run at 50 - 80 fps.

# Conclusion

The conclusion is this game is good and can be better in terms of performance as I already said that the performance bother me a little to the experience that I got, but overall is good and worth to play.
