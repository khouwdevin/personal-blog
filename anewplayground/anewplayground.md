# A New Playground



I have been learning Linux recently and it has been a pleasent journey for me to learn it, not only about Linux but VPS and things related to it which I will tell more through this blog.

# How it started

I always curious about server, especially in CI/CD world which I do not really understand how it works. At the beginning, I had been thinking about raspberry pi as started for me to learn, but it does not come cheap and I need to save some money to buy it, then finally I had enough money to buy it. For Linux itself, I have been using WSL 2 for learning Linux and I already have the configuration for the Linux, but then I did not realize that Homebrew does not work with ARM chip which raspberry pi has, I thought it would be just a few lines of command and it would be all set, but no worries I managed to set it up at the end.

It was great to have raspberry pi, so many things I want to do and now I can do it on raspberry pi, but then one thing bother me, I only can do it locally which what if I want to serve something that I need to get from anywhere in this world? Port forwarding is one of the solution but still it will need money for the subscription, then I thought why I am just renting a server, I do not really need a lot of CPUs and RAM, then I started to search the best VPS and I found Netcup and I chose to use the 4 CPUs and 4 RAM, and it is great, I love it.

The journey is not stopping there, it only just started, finally, I have public IP which means I have the ability to serve services online. Also, one thing I realize why people always say about Docker and Docker and Docker, it really helps, even a lot of help, it is so easy to use and I do not need to think just use Docker for all my apps. 

# Apps

I saw people promote apps for Linux to make your life easier, I thought Linux is about command line, right? Why people still use tools? It was a wrong idea and it is very simple mindset **"If you have a way to make your life easier why will you choose harder one."**.

I have a few apps that I use constantly for developing apps and running apps, let's dive in.

## Yazi

> yazi is a damn good tool for surf on your file system, it will visualize the folder you have, navigating will feel easier and manage your files will feel more satisfying.

## Lazygit and Lazydokcer

> lazygit and lazydocker are the ultimate tools for me, it will make your life easier and less stressful when making the app up and running, it is just simple, a terminal UI.

## Neovim

> neovim, a tool that only Jedi programmer will use, it is not that scary apparently, it turns out easy to use too, and why university is not taught this to the students?

# Next plan

I am planning to create a RPG game using TUI (terminal UI) in Go, I want to try Rust, but I think there are a lot of things I have to learn, beside the low level code it has, but my lack of experience in low level language too. I will post the progress in my blog.

Closing, although it is a short blog, I am grateful to share this and about a new playground that I found recently, I still have a lot of things to be learned but, **being a software engineer is not a mistake, it is a fun process, I promise.**
