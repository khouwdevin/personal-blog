I'm a person that think maybe I will buy second generation Steam Deck because I was concern about the performance, but then one day I thought that it would be nice if I had a Steam Deck, feel like excited to try something new, it stayed for a few days in my head and finally I bought it about two weeks ago. I didn't expect much but the curiosity flooded and wanted to know why people is excited about this handheld era.

The journey was started after I ordered it on marketplace, it felt like wasting money because I have a powerful PC that can play anything, but also I thought that it would be nice if I could play games on bed. For a few weeks past I could say that it was worth it to put money for Steam Deck. For me, it is like a mini PC, but people will think that why it uses linux and it's not a problem for me because I'm used to use Linux OS and in terms of performance I would say that Valve is smart to build the OS using Linux.

It's enough to talk about Steam Deck on the surface, let's dive a little bit, to give opinions from my perspective.

### What do I expect at first ?

Honestly, it was not much, I like to watch people benchmarking a hardware and in my opinion it is something that we can measure how powerful a hardware is and how much the hardware is supporting the improvement of technology. I decided to play light games and will play heavy games on my laptop and it turns out I have different games install on both devices, I installed games that console like games on Steam Deck and mostly competitive games on my laptop. And it is really fun to play games without a need to sit down in front of a laptop and can move to different places in the house to play games.

The second thing I didn't expect to have was the performance of the battery, I already saw that the battery won't last for hours on playing heavy 3D game, but the thing that I forget is they put on full blast when testing and it is different to how we use it daily. For example, I limit the FPS mostly on 45 FPS so the battery will last longer and if I play deck on bed I consider to use the charger plugged while I'm playing, you will think that it will harm the battery but after I did a research the deck has pass through system that will put the charging state on 90% - 100% range, so I often use charger while playing like I always do to my laptop.

Other thing that I expected to be good was the panel, I like the OLED panel that deck has, but I don't see any major different, maybe I'm used to see the AMOLED panel on my phone so it feels the same, but one thing you should remember OLED won't let you down, it's a great panel!

### Peformance

The deck isn't that powerful to put everything on ultra, especially on newer games. But the thing is as other reviewers said, I and they are happy for the performance. It's very important for developer who wants make their games work properly on deck to optimize their games, if the game is optimized I'm sure it will be run great on the deck.

It's very suprising to see emulators run great on Steam Deck, it has slightly performance different between PC and deck, it can be tolerance by me so far. For games like PS2, PSP, DS and other early consoles gen it will run great. The tips from me is better to buy micro SD that you're desire but I recomend to buy at least 128 GB, it will has a capacity of 20 games or more for the emulators, don't forget to put the emulators apps and games on the micro SD so you have a full capacity on main storage for Steam games.

If you curious about the performance deeper, I will tell you a few games that I play on deck and emulators. Currently, I play Divinity Original Sins 2 on med - high setting and I limit the fps to 45 fps, it has hiccups for heavy scenes that have a lot NPC like in town, but it won't drop that much and make you feel uncomfortable to play it. For older games I installed Persona 4 Golden, NFS Heat, Yakuza Kiwami, Ni No Kuni, Skyrim and other games, it runs perfectly fine. For heavy 3D games it will draw 20W or more and it will cause the battery to drop faster but that's okay, what you need is to bring charger and plug it whenever you can and so far the battery will last up to 4 hours for games like Persona 4 Golden and Skyrim, I think it would be enough and I'm happy about it.

### Mods

Case, who doesn't like case, a thing to protect your device. I have the 512 GB model for the deck and I put non reflective tempered glass and use JSAUX case, because the main travel case is too big and it won't fit comfortably on small bag. It would be a different story if you use the JSAUX case, it has both sides cover so you needn't to worry. The main scenario that I had in my head was, it would be perfect to bring the deck when you travel, you could bring the charger and JSAUX case on your small bag and put the main case in your suitcase, because if you need to spend a very long time on the plane you could plug the deck so you won't run out of battery.

### Mini PC

As I said earlier Steam Deck capable to run desktop mode and I treat the deck as my PC. I already installed Discord and Spotify, don't you want to play and listen to music at the same time, what a dream! And you can because it has apps store to install apps that you usually use on PC! Just a few tutorial to watch and knowing how put the apps into dock mode and you are ready to go, I've tested Spotify and it works like a charm! But one thing, Valve if you read this, please fix the dock mode! When you stack a few apps and want to use mouse function, I found the deck is still buggy and feel like it has a problem with stack apps so you can't use mouse function easilly, but I believe they will fix it soon.

### Conclusion

It was a great experience and will be a great experience in the future with the deck. It cost a quite expensive for me in Indonesia, but it is very worth it if you want to have a best experience with a handheld, I strongly suggest you to buy Steam Deck because it has dedicated OS that Valve will support at their best, and it's Valve what thing they can't do? They are the best and you will know if you choose Steam Deck, hopefully they will release an improvement Steam Deck in the future continuously. For me, the down side just like the unsupported games, lower performance from other handheld brand and unable to play games from PC Game Pass, that's all! It is all easily to be tolerance. At last, don't forget to use your main rig after bought Steam Deck, don't be like me, Bye!
