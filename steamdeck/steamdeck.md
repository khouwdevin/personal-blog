I'm a person that think maybe I will buy second generation Steam Deck because I was concern about the performance, but then one day I thought that I would be nice if I had a Steam Deck, feel like excited to try something new, it stayed for a few days in my head and finally I bought it about two weeks ago. I didn't expect much but the curiosity was overflowed and wanted to know why people is excited about portable pc or we can call handheld.

The journey was started after I ordered it on marketplace, it felt like wasting money because I have a powerful PC that can play anything on high or ultra, but also I thought that I would be nice if I could play games on bed. For a few weeks that past I could say that I was worth it to put money for Steam Deck. For me, it is a mini PC, but people will think that it uses linux and it's not a problem for me because I used to use the linux OS and in terms of performance I would say that Valve is so smart and put effort to start from very bottom to build the SteamOS that also will make them easier to tune the Steam Deck in the future.

It's enough to talk about Steam Deck on the surface, let's dive a little bit, to give opinions from my perspective as software engineer and game developer.

### What do I expect at first ?

<GithubImage path="steamdeck/public/1.jpg" alt="Steam Deck" width="full"/>

Honestly, it was not much, I like to watch people benchmarking a hardware and in my opinion it is something that we can measure how powerful is a hardware and how much the hardware is supporting the improvement of technology. I decided to play light games and will play heavy games in terms of performance on my laptop and it turns out I have different games install on both devices, I installed games that console like games on Steam Deck and mostly competitive games on my laptop. And it is really fun to play games withouth a need to sit down in front of my laptop and can move to different places in the house to play games.

The second thing I didn't expect to have was the performance of the battery, I already saw that the battery won't last for hours on playing heavy 3D games, but the thing that I forget is they put on full blast when testing and it is different to how we use it daily. For example, I put the fps limit mostly on 45 FPS so the battery will last longer and if I play deck on bed I consider to use charger plug while I'm playing, you will think that it will harm the battery but after I searched if deck has pass through thing or system that will put the charging state on stuck in specific percentage and it does, so I often use charger while playing like I always do to my laptop.

Other thing I expected to be good was the panel, I know that OLED panels are great but in my experience I don't feel something that like it damn good, I don't know maybe I used to use an AMOLED panel so I already had a good standard on panels.

### Peformance

It is what you see on Youtube is what you get. The deck isn't that powerful so you can put on ultra on everything, especially on newer games. But the thing is as other reviewers said I and they are happy about the performance. It's very important for developer who wants make their games work properly on deck keep the attention to optimize the games, if the game is optimized I'm sure it will be run great on the deck.

Suprisingly, it's very suprising to see emulators run great on Steam Deck and don't expect to have better performance than PCs can do, what games aren't running great on PCs it will be the same if we use deck. For games like PS2, PSP, DS and other early consoles gen it will run great. Tips for you, better to buy micro SD at your desire but I recomend at least 128 GB to have, it will has a capacity of 20 games and more for the emulators, put the emulators apps and games on the micro SD so you have a full capacity on main storage.

If you curious about the performance deeper, I will tell you a few games that I play on deck also emulators too. Currently, I play Divinity Original Sins 2 on med - high setting also limit the fps to 45 fps, it has hiccups for heavy scenes that have a lot NPC like in town, but it won't drop that much so you will uncomfortable to play, it is a great experience I have. For older games I installed Persona 4 Golden, NFS Heat, Yakuza Kiwami, Ni No Kuni, Skyrim and other games it runs great and for heavy 3D games it will draw 20W or more and it causes the battery to drop faster but that's okay, because you buy to play on the go right? And I'm sure that you will have a place to charge it and if you go for a while I think you wouldn't need a charger because play for 3 hours of Skyrim or Persona 4 Golden will be enough right?

### Mods

Cases, who doesn't like cases, thing to protect your device. I have the 512 GB model for the deck and I put non reflective tempred glass also put JSAUX case, because the main travel case is too big and it won't comfortably fit on small bag and it has different story if you use the JSAUX case it has both sides cover so you needn't to worry about the protection that you have, it is secure, chill bro! The main scenario that I had in my head was, it would be perfect to bring the deck when you travel, you bring the charger and JSAUX case on your small bag and put the main case in the suitcase, because if you must spend a very long time in the plane you will need charger so you won't run out of battery and hopefully you have electricity to be used.

### Mini PC

As I said earlier Steam Deck capable to run desktop mode and I treat the deck as my PC. Recently I installed Discord and Spotify, don't you want to play and listen to music at the same time, what a dream! And you can because it supports for you to install apps that you usually use on PC! Just a few tutorial to watch and knowing how put the apps into dock mode and you are ready to go, I've tested Spotify and it works like a charm, very good and pleasent! But one thing, Valve if you read this, please fix on dock mode when you stack a few apps and want to use mouse, it still buggy and feel like it mix with other app so you can't use mouse features easilly, but I believe they will fix it soon.

### Conclusion

It was a great experience and will be a great experience in the future that I had and I will have with the deck. It cost a quite expensive price for me in Indonesia, but it is very worth it if you want to have a best experience with current gen handheld. I suggest you to buy the deck because it has dedicated OS that Valve will support for a long time, and it's Valve why you don't believe them? Kidding bro, but they are the best and you will know if you choose Steam Deck, hopefully they will release a better one consistenly in the future. And for the down side for me just like the unsupported games and lower performance from other platform and unable to play games from PC Game Pass, that's all, but it is managable to be handled. At last, don't forget to use your main rig, don't be like me, Bye!
