## What is Stalker Bot

<GithubImage path="stalkerbot/public/stalkerbot.png" height="200px"/>

### History

**Stalker** Bot is Discord bot that I made for my personal bot at first to update people Instagram, Youtube etc. that's why I named it **Stalker**, because it will always be watching you. But later till today I think **Stalker** need a shift of functionality, and I decide that **Stalker** will be a server manager, that will help to manage server. Currently, **Stalker** has simple commands and will continue to be developed until it matchs my need and maybe people needs.

### For who

**Stalker** is available for everyone, you can request it [here](https://khouwdevin.com/stalkerbot). But, do you need **Stalker**? I can elaborate some reasons if you need it or not, everything that **Stalker** can do I will list them below. So, the reasons you need a simple bot, that can do polling, create Discord event using slash command (maybe in the future **Stalker** will help you to manage meeting in Discord using event). Or maybe you need to take notes for absences, it will help you summarize all and create report (this feature will be developed if it really help and it is needed).
