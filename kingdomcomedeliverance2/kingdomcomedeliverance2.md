Ah, it is like just yesterday I played the first one and suddenly I got the second one, I was shocked when Warhorse Studio announced the sequel, I was happy to be able play again and continue Henry's story. It was back then when I played for the first time in 2021 I think, the story was good and the gameplay was fantastic, let's stop nostalgia and continue to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.

# Story

<GithubImage path="kingdomcomedeliverance2/public/1.png" alt="Henry"/>

The story continues from the first which it starts with Sir Capon and Henry travel to negotiate with other lord in other region, to be honest the beginning of the story is not really hooked me, not like the first one where it was intense and could hook me, the second sequel is still intense but the beginning not really hooked me, do not worry, I felt it but maybe it may differ one to another.

Warhorse introduce a few new characters in the game which will have impact to the story. The new characters have their own charms, Warhorse done it perfectly, I often asked to myself, who is this, why he or she do that along the gameplay, still curious till I get the answer, it is a very good story, good job!

One more thing I love about Warhorse is the plot twist, I think they have mastered it somehow, in the campaign I often said what, damn, and how, I did not expect that kind of thing they make at the story, although it is a simple matter of kingdom, that we often see in series and movies but still I love the story, so nice.

For the side quests, The types are similar to the first one, many unique stories and not generic fetch quest, if you have played the first one, you would know what to expect from the sequel. I feel in this sequel it has a lot of stealling things for its side quests, not a bad thing of course, but I just realized that it is a lot.

# Gameplay

God be praised! They did a perfect job at balancing the combat, fun fact from me, I had a hard time to these new mechanics, it is good to have such a good muscle memory but what can I do if they change it? Lol. Let me explain, they change the attack direction to five directions where the original has six directions, they also change the buttons for combat only use the two rear triggers, and simplified the direction for stab into bottom direction, it was stressful moments when I lose a combat to a muscle memory.

The combat itself is balance now, where the master strike cannot be used with one trigger, you must think to put your stance, because now master strike will use the attack from the opposite direction of your enemy stance, if you fail you will get hit, it will not be easy at first but for me it is make sense as I think if they make the duel online, nobody will attack first, it will be a waiting game.

Also, they added smithing, now we can make our own weapon from the recipe. It gives a fresh mechanic that important because we will do smithing in main quest and side quest. The old mechanics are still the same, they are not changing it. Also, they added photo mode, it is a good feature to have.

# Performance

I am the person who pre ordered one month before, I think what could be bad, but then I watched Youtube videos about KCD and they said they expected that Warhorse will fix after release, but then surprise surprise, they did not even release the day one patch, the performance is stable and rarely have a spike, I was happy, knowing my machine is not longer a high end spec (I'm using 12700h and RTX 3070ti). I cap it on 55 fps using the built in vsync, I do not know why they provide at 55 fps not 60 fps but that is okay, I enjoy while playing it.

What about Steam Deck, I always happy to know if the game can be played on Steam Deck and they gave a surprise again, I think it was one week before they released a video said the game got "playable" status on Steam Deck, made me think at that time, how light the game would be? And yes it is light and the performance is perfect compare to games that released recently.

The performance is great but it has drawback from the engine, I felt it too on the first sequel, that Cry Engine cannot handle a lot of NPC it will drop the fps quite far, and I got the validation too from Sony in The Lazy Monday, so far it only has a few battles that requires a lot of NPC but it does not really ruin your gameplay, they did a great job to the performance.

# Issue

<GithubImage path="kingdomcomedeliverance2/public/6.png" alt="Old bug"/>

I want to share the issues I found, especially for the mechanics and the bugs, it is not a deal for me that I needed to put efforts to sell items, the money that merchants have are very little, I do not know what happen, I often sold my items in Kuttenberg, it is a big city, but why the money they have is so little, I needed to wait one to two days to be able sell my items, it was annoying but it was not a big deal for me.

Beside the money, I found another that quite annoying about stuck, mostly it will stuck on stairs, before you go up, it will stuck on the first stair, other than that a lot of old bugs, like Henry is not facing to the NPC when talking, like the picture I have below, you can see Henry is facing backward and not sitting, but that is okay it is funny tho.

# Conclusion

<GithubImage path="kingdomcomedeliverance2/public/7.png" alt="The end"/>

We come to conclusion, I love this game, so far this is the best game for 2025 and Warhorse becomes my favorite studio, I hope they will release high quality games in the future, with the fame they have know, they should get investment to make a great game. Also, they will release three DLCs in this year, I will wait that and I hope it will have a big DLC.
