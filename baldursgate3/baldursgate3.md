I would say that **Baldur's Gate 3** brings RPG game to its peak glory, 10/10 score that I give, so many things to explore, full of content, and rich story that combine all make it a masterpiece of an RPG game.

Hello, I'm Devin, I'll give you a review for **Baldur's Gate 3**, if you are new here, I will review a game from my perspective also I will give you recommendation based on a few categories that I will tell in the end of this review. Shall we begin?

# Story

From its story, it'll bring you to a lore which you are infected by a tadpole from a mindflyer and you'll begin your journey to find a cure. Don't worry if you never play **Baldur's Gate**, personally this is my first time play **Baldur's Gate** and I can easily follow the story. For its story, I can say that they **(Larian Studio)** hired a genius story writer, it's a top notch story and it'll make you always curious to what happens next.

However, I have a disappointment to its dynamic of the story, I feel it already peak in the middle of the game, which is the second act (no more explanation, you can play it by yourself and tell me if it's true :) ). And for the rest, no else thing that **Baldur's Gate 3** can give except the perfection to its story deliver.

# Gameplay

Now, we continue to the gameplay, which for me it's positive and negative. For some reasons, I prefer to walk use **"WASD"** rather than click to move, but I understand that it's a CRPG and it's how most of the CRPG games use. At first I feel a little strange to move the camera using **"WASD"**, but after a while I became a master to its move. And the advantage to use free / fly camera, you can spot hidden places, which I think it's a key feature to its exploration to find a hidden place (this is the thing that I like the most, to enter forbidden places).

The combat, I think it will be something that yes or no for some people, fyi, I never touch a game with this type of combat, and I was a bit skeptic, but then I surprised I can enjoy the combat that much, I put balance for the difficulty and I feel in balance difficulty there're too many miss attack, magic, etc., but I can't complain more because this is my first time into a CRPG. And for you that fear you won't understand the combat mechanics, relax you'll be doing just fine as you progress in the game.

# Graphic

Next, the graphic, I don't know what to say and how to say, **it's incredible!**, for now I can say it has a gorgeous graphic especially for the characters, if it's close enough you can see the character pores on their face, but unfortunately, you will get a high quality models only in dialogs and I expect Larian will update photo mode, so we can capture a high quality from the characters, I will show you a few photos that I capture!

# Conclusion

We come to a conclusion, there's no doubt to give this game a 10/10 because its quality that I rarely find on games that have been released currently, but the question, is this game for you? I will help you to answer.

## This game is for you if:

- you are a casual gamer that want to try a new experience.
- you don't hate turn - base games, for sure!
- you like to read, listen and watch a heavy story, because **Baldur's Gate 3** has a lot of dialogs and documents.
- you like to try something new, a hype game (?)


## This game is not for you if:

- you don't like turn - base games.
- not willing to learn things to its mechanics.
- you are too lazy to follow its story (don't waste your money because 70% of time is dialogs)
- you don't have enough money :), because it's quite expensive.
